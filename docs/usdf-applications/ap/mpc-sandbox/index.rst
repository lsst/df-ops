MPC Sandbox

Overview
========
.. Include short summary of application, service, or database

During commissioning, Rubin will send data to a private, Rubin-only, submission stream at the Minor Planet Center. Theyâ€™ll process these data and store them into a private, rubin-only, instance of the *MPCORB* database. This will prevent the leakage of private Rubin data to the public before the First Look event. This parallel system called *the sandbox*.

.. Include Application Grouping, Operating Hours (24x7, PST daytime, or observing), Criticality Level, a link to the GitHub repository, and Slack channel used for support of the application.
