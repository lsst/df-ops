Prompt Keda application information.

Architecture
============
.. Describe the architecture of the application including key components (e.g API servers, databases, messaging components and their roles).  Describe relevant network configuration.

KEDA is deployed with the KEDA operator in the Prompt Processing vClusters in the ``keda`` Kubernetes namespace.

KEDA controls autoscaling for Prompt Processing.  KEDA uses scalars to determine how aggressively to scale up and down.  Prompt KEDA is configured to autoscale based on the number of Fanned Out events in Prompt Redis.

Architecture Diagram
====================
.. Include architecture diagram of the application either as a mermaid chart or a picture of the diagram.

See :ref:`prompt_processing_architecture_diagram`

Associated Systems
==================
.. Describe other applications are associated with this applications.

See :ref:`prompt_processing_associated_systems`

Configuration Location
======================
.. Detail where the configuration is stored.  This is typically in GitHub, Kubernetes Configuration Maps, and/or Vault Secrets.
