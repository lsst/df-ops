There are over fifty Rubin applications installed at the USDF and the number is growing.  An application grouping was developed to organize applications by common process and function. The groupings are not an organization chart.  The below application groups are used organize Rubin Applications at the USDF.  The applications are organized by these groupings on the :doc:`../usdf-applications/index`.
