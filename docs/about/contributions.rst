We actively encourage collaboration in building of the Data Facilities website and understand that there will not be any "one size fits all" set of rules for contributing to this website. As such, we present the following best practices with the hopes that folks will engage with it in the spirit that is intendedâ€”as a method of reducing conflict and not restraining the ability to contribute.

Contribution Best Practices
===========================
In all cases, please make sure that all Github build tests succeed correctly prior to merging, so as to ensure that the website remains operational.

If you are a service documentation lead, please feel free to update your service documentation without requesting review from USDF personnel.

If you are service operational support, please feel free to update the service documentation without requesting review from USDF personnel. Consider checking in with the relevant documentation lead for best practices or review.

If you are a service user, please request review from the relevant service documentation lead prior to any merge.

If you are editing a non-service specific page and the change is significant, please request review either directly from any appropriate parties or through the #usdf-support Slack channel prior to any merge.
