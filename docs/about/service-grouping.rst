Service Grouping
################

There are over fifty Rubin services comprised of applications and databases installed at the USDF and the number is growing.  A service grouping was developed to organize services by common process and function. The groupings are not an organization chart.  The below services groups are used organize Rubin Applications at the USDF.  The services are organized by these groupings on the :doc:`../usdf-applications/index`.
