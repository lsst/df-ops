Report Incident in Slack
========================

Slack channels in the Rubin Observatory Slack instance are used to report incidents.  An on call rotation is created to monitor the below Slack channels during daytime working hours.  The on call rotation uses the Slack group handles below and should be used when creating incidents.  Please refrain from @ a specific person when creating the incident.  Note that Slack channels will not be monitored during observing as SLAC is not currently staffed for this.

In the event that Slack is down email and Zoom will be used.
